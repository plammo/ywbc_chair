					<h4>The Chair</h4>
					<p class="description"> The Mademoiselle is a elegant yet vivacious chair, with a style which harks back to the 1960's.
					  A flamboyant and bold textile set into a form and structure that is quintessentially modernist; 
					  it encapsulates the dichotomy of an era, trying to embrace both order and anarchy.</p>

					<h4 class="designer">The Designer - Phillipe Starck</h4>
					<p class="description">Starckâ€™s career started to climb in earnest in 
						1982 when he designed the interior for the private apartments of the French President.
						Starck has worked independently as an interior designer and 
						as a product designer since 1975. Most notably, in 2002, he created a number of 
						relatively inexpensive product designs for the large American retailer Target Stores.
