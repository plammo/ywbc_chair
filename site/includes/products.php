					<h4>The Chair</h4>
					<p class="description"> The Mademoiselle is a elegant yet vivacious chair, with a style which harks back to the 1960's.
					  A flamboyant and bold textile set into a form and structure that is quintessentially modernist; 
					  it encapsulates the dichotomy of an era, trying to embrace both order and anarchy.</p>
